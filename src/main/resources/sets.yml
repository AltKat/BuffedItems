#                       BUFFED ITEMS - SETS.YML
# ===================================================================
#
# This file allows you to create "Item Sets" to grant special bonuses
# to players who wear or hold multiple items from the same collection.
#
# We RECOMMEND using the in-game editor (/bi menu -> Item Sets)
# to make changes easily without editing this file manually.
#
# If you edit this file manually, use /bi reload to apply changes.
# This file contains limited information. Please see wiki for more info.

# --- CONFIGURATION GUIDE ---
#
# sets:
#   unique_set_id:        <-- Unique identifier for the set.
#     display_name: "&6Set Name"  <-- Name used in GUI menus.
#
#     items:              <-- List of BuffedItem IDs that belong to this set.
#       - item_id_1
#       - item_id_2
#
#     bonuses:            <-- Define effects based on active piece count.
#       2:                <-- When player has 2 items from this set:
#         potion_effects:
#           - SPEED;1
#         attributes:
#           - GENERIC_MAX_HEALTH;ADD_NUMBER;2.0
#       3:                <-- When player has 3 items:
#         ...
#
# --- LOGIC & RULES ---
# 1. Cumulative Bonuses:
#    If a player has 3 pieces, they receive BOTH the '2-piece' and '3-piece' bonuses.
#    Bonuses stack on top of each other.
#
# 2. Equipment Slots:
#    - Armor (Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, Boots) ONLY counts if equipped
#      in their respective armor slots. Holding armor in hand does NOT count.
#    - Weapons/Tools/Other items count if held in Main Hand or Off-Hand.
#    - Items just sitting in the inventory (not held/worn) do NOT count.
#
# 3. Permissions:
#    If an item requires a specific permission to use (defined in items.yml),
#    and the player lacks it, that item will NOT count towards the set bonus.
