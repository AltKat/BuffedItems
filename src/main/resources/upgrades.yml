#                       BUFFED ITEMS - UPGRADES.YML
# ===================================================================
#
# This file allows you to create upgrade recipes for your BuffedItems.
# Players can use the Upgrade Station (/bi upgrade) to upgrade their items.
#
# We RECOMMEND using the in-game editor (/bi menu -> Configure Upgrades)
# to make changes easily without editing this file manually.
#
# If you edit this file manually, use /bi reload to apply changes.
